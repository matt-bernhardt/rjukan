# Rjukan

This is a demonstration interface for the [SolarSPELL](http://pacificschoolserver.org/) project, developed in AngularJS. It is being developed to add a faceted browse feature to the existing file-based navigation.

The interface can be seen in action at https://matt-bernhardt.github.io/rjukan
